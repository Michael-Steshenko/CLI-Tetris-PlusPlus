# CLI-Tetris++
Command line tetris for Linux / WSL.  
This is just a for fun project and will be rewritten in C and Go for comparison.
Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

# Building
- Build in vscode (`CTRL+SHIFT+B`), the build config is in tasks.json
- Alternatively run g++ `g++ -o tetris.out *.cpp`

# TODO
- Currently I hide the cursor on program bootstrap, I should figure out a way of enabling it back when program quits / crashes.
